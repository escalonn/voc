pretty cool
first time loaded lab, frozen
    close browser, reload, fine after that
terminal working fine
click on fullscreen button
    the x to get back out disappears when you mouse over it, annoying
    escape still works
end lab -> useless UI
    known issue, maybe we can remove that button?
first assignment (prime)
    liked the question's difficulty level
    pressing F5 -> launch.json, not implemented
        we should fix this
    debug -> launch.json, not implemented
        we should fix this
    no c# extension -> no intellisense/highlighting feedback, no emmet
        we should fix this
third assignment (mvc views)
    bit easy
    didnt finish yes, didnt check on desktop part yet
    grade and grade report separation confusing
