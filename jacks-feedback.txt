pretty cool
first time loaded lab, frozen
    close browser, reload, fine after that
terminal working fine
click on fullscreen button
    the x to get back out disappears when you mouse over it, annoying
    escape still works
end lab -> useless UI
    known issue, maybe we can remove that button?
first assignment (prime)
    liked the question's difficulty level
    pressing F5 -> launch.json, not implemented
        we should fix this
    debug -> launch.json, not implemented
        we should fix this
    no c# extension -> no intellisense/highlighting feedback, no emmet
        we should fix this
third assignment (mvc views)
    bit easy
    didnt finish yes, didnt check on desktop part yet
    grade and grade report separation confusing

--

didnt notice desktop environment despite instructions in readme
browser would sometimes crash on google search
ubuntu options like lock screen, logout, bit confusing
    should mention that
warning - unable to bind to localhost for ipv6
    should check this out to make sure it's not an issue, but it's probably not
2nd assignment
    good difficulty
3rd assignment, ways to make it more challenging
    convert between viewmodels and domain model
    display a list of items, with tag helpers and html helpers
